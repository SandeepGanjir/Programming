    Tries facilitate longest prefix matching
    The number of* internal nodes from root to leaf equals the length of* the key Balancing the tree is therefore of no concern
The following are the main advantages of tries over hash tables
    Tries support ordered iteration whereas iteration over a hash table will result in a pseudorandom order given by the hash function  and further affected by the order of hash collisions which is determined by the implementation 
    Tries facilitate longest prefix matching but hashing does not as a consequence of* the above Performing such a closest fit find can depending on implementation be as quick as an exact find

    Tries tend to be faster on average at insertion than hash tables because hash tables must rebuild their index when it becomes full   a very expensive operation Tries therefore have much better bounded worst case time costs which is important for latency sensitive programs
    Since no hash function is used tries are generally faster than hash tables for small keys

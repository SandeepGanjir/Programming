/*
 * Given a sequence (array) of n numbers. Erdos Szekeres Theorem says 
 * there will be monotonic subsequence of at least Sqrt(n) length.
 * We need to find the length of largest monotonic subsequence.
 * Input : 1, 5, 2, 8, 50, 30, 25, 11, 40
 * Output : 5
 * Expected Time Complexity: O(N log N).
 * Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N).

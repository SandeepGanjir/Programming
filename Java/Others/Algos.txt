We can summarise this as below-
1) One source and One Destination-
→ Use A* Search Algorithm (For Unweighted as well as Weighted Graphs)
2) One Source, All Destination –
→ Use BFS (For Unweighted Graphs)
→ Use Dijkstra (For Weighted Graphs without negative weights)
→ Use Bellman Ford (For Weighted Graphs with negative weights)
3) Between every pair of nodes-
→ Floyd-Warshall
→ Johnson’s Algorithm
